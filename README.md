# bamazon

To run this application, you will need MySQL and Node JS installed on your computer.

If you do not have MySQL database already set up on your machine, visit the MySQL installation page to install the version you need for your operating system. Once you have MySQL installed, you will be able to create the Bamazon database and the products table with the SQL code found in bamazon.sql. Run this code inside your MySQL client to populate the database, then you will be ready to proceed with running the Bamazon customer and manager interfaces.

Once you have the Bamazon database set up, run this command in the command line: node bamazonCustomer.js
